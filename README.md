# CodingAdvent2k20 :christmas_tree:
This Repository contains my code solutions for the "Advent of Code - 2012" activity. The solutions are written with **TypeScript**. 
I can really recommend this activity if you're new to programming, want to improve your skills or if you just want to learn a new language - as I do with **TS**.

Wanna try it yourself? The description of each day (programming puzzle) can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

## Get my code!
**Feel free to have a look into my code** - I would really appreciate it, if you find any code smells or just bad syntax habits -> let me know. 
Furthermore if you are new to TypeScript and do not know how to execute it, here are some little steps.

* First of all you should have installed [*node.js*](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). _Check with `npm --version` if it has already been installed!_
* Next you should run a shell and enter `npm install -g typescript` to install typescript
* After that you just have to open an **editor** (_e.g.: Visual Studio Code_). Clone or even fork my repo and open it!
* The last step you need to do is use the shell,  _cd_ to the local cloned repo path and just enter `node main` 

_You should now see all my results for the diffrent days/puzzles._

## Merry Christmas and Happy Coding :santa::christmas_tree::computer::vulcan_salute:
